# SMGeo
This repository is the official implementation of ArXiv "SMGeo: Cross-View Object Geo-Localization with Grid-Level Mixture-of-Experts"
## 📌 Abstract

Cross-view object geo-localization aims to precisely pinpoint the same object across large-scale satellite imagery based on drone images. Due to significant differences in viewpoint and scale, coupled with complex background interference, traditional multi-stage *retrieval–matching* pipelines are prone to cumulative errors. To address these challenges, we present **SMGeo**, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object geo-localization. The proposed model supports **click-based prompting** and can output object geo-localization results **in real time**, enabling interactive use. SMGeo adopts a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a **Swin Transformer** for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery, together with an **anchor-free transformer detection head** for direct coordinate regression. To better capture both **inter-view** and **intra-view** dependencies, we further introduce a **grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE)** module into the cross-view encoder. This design allows the network to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the **content, scale, and source** of each spatial grid. In addition, the anchor-free detection head predicts object locations via **heatmap-based supervision** on reference images, avoiding the scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes.

## 📊 Results and Visualization

### 1. Quantitative Results

We evaluate SMGeo on the **CVOGL_DroneAerial** benchmark and compare it with several representative cross-view geo-localization methods.  
The performance is reported in terms of **acc@0.25**, **acc@0.5**, and **mIoU** on both the test and validation sets.

> SMGeo consistently outperforms previous methods by a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of grid-level Mixture-of-Experts modeling for cross-view object geo-localization.

### 2. Qualitative Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods

We visualize object geo-localization results produced by different methods, including **TransGeo**, **DSTG**, and **SMGeo**.

- **Red box**: ground-truth object location  
- **Colored boxes**: predicted localization results  
- **Star marker**: query object

SMGeo yields significantly more accurate localization results, especially in complex urban scenes with severe background clutter and scale variation.

### 3. Cross-View Localization Results (Drone → Satellite)

We further present qualitative results on drone-to-satellite geo-localization across different object scales.

- **First row**: query images captured from drones  
- **Second row**: satellite reference images  
- **Third row**: localization results produced by SMGeo  

The results are grouped into **small**, **medium**, and **large** target scenarios, showing that SMGeo maintains robust performance across varying object scales.

### 4. Response Heatmap Visualization

To better understand the model’s localization behavior, we visualize the **response heatmaps** generated by SMGeo.

- The heatmaps highlight regions with high confidence responses
- Accurate localization corresponds to concentrated and well-aligned activation regions

These visualizations indicate that SMGeo effectively suppresses background noise while focusing on the true object location.

### 6. Expert Activation Visualization (Ablation Analysis)

To analyze the behavior of the grid-level Mixture-of-Experts module, we visualize the **expert activation maps** at different encoder stages.

- Each grid cell is assigned a color indicating its activated expert
- Different stages exhibit distinct expert specialization patterns

The visualization script is provided as:

```bash
